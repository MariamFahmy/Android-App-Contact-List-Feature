# Contact List Feature 
- Created two classes, Contact and ContactList to implement a contact list feature in an Android app for sharing items with borrowers.
- Applied encapsulation with information hiding by making all fields private and providing getters and setters.
- Used the UUID Java class to give a unique id to each contact; this made it easy to implement the method int getIndex(Contact contact)
