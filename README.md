# Contact List Feature 
Created two classes, Contact and ContactList to implement a contact list feature in an Android app for sharing items with borrowers.
Implemented encapsulation, made all fields private and provided getters and setters.
Used the UUID Java class to give a unique id to each contact; this made it easy to implement the method int getIndex(Contact contact)
